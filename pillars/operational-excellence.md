# Operational Excellence Pillar

## Objective
Run and monitor systems effectively, and continuously improve processes and procedures to deliver business value.

## Common Issues Seen in AWS Accounts
- Manual deployments and configuration changes
- Lack of monitoring and alerting
- No documented operational procedures
- Reactive troubleshooting instead of proactive improvement

## Key Review Questions
- Are operational procedures documented and followed?
- Is monitoring and alerting in place for critical systems?
- Are changes tested and automated where possible?
- Is operational data used to improve processes?

## Improvement Approaches
- Automate deployments and routine operations
- Use monitoring and alerts to detect issues early
- Document runbooks and operational procedures
- Review incidents and apply lessons learned

## Architecture Trade-offs
Automation and monitoring require upfront effort, but they significantly reduce operational risk and long-term overhead.
